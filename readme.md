# Attention

This is one of the most celebrated applications in the field of deep learning. Basically what attention does is to mimic what our brain does. 
Human Brain does not process a whole visual snapshot of what it sees instead it looks at a particular portion of something and the process it sequentially over time. Applying the same principal to computer vision we can get really good results such as if we use an eye tracking with another camera to see what the eye sees we can represent to the machine how our brain is learning.
